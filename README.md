### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've always been passionate about the world of technology; my curiosity to understand how everything works makes me someone who is constantly seeking knowledge and skill enhancement.

My focus is on optimizing processes, and I consider myself dedicated, creative, with a strong sense of analysis, and possessing good interpersonal skills.

I speak English, Portuguese, and intermediate Spanish. Currently, I am studying PHP, CSS3, Python and JavaScript.
